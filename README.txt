Hi! This is a regular counter. 
I personally write it to account for the work done, 
but you can use it for something else...

Press -space- to add one unit.
Press -z- to subtract one unit.
Press -r- to reset counter
Press -Tab- to redraw value on screen.
Press -d- to delete all data from the database.

You can also open an -.txt- file
that is in the folder with the code
to see all the changes. 

P.s. If something doesn't work? then it's not my fault)
